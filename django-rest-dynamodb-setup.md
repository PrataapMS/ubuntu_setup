###### Important
```
DynamoDB on your computer requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 6.x or newer; it will not run on older JRE versions.
```

Command Line Options

DynamoDB running on your computer accepts the following command line options:

-cors value — Enable CORS support (cross-origin resource sharing) for JavaScript. You must provide a comma-separated "allow" list of specific domains. The default setting for -cors is an asterisk (*), which allows public access.
-dbPath value — The directory where DynamoDB will write its database file. If you do not specify this option, the file will be written to the current directory. Note that you cannot specify both -dbPath and -inMemory at once.
-delayTransientStatuses — Causes DynamoDB to introduce delays for certain operations. DynamoDB can perform some tasks almost instantaneously, such as create/update/delete operations on tables and indexes; however, the actual DynamoDB service requires more time for these tasks. Setting this parameter helps DynamoDB simulate the behavior of the Amazon DynamoDB web service more closely. (Currently, this parameter introduces delays only for global secondary indexes that are in either CREATING or DELETING status.)
-help — Prints a usage summary and options.
-inMemory — DynamoDB; will run in memory, instead of using a database file. When you stop DynamoDB;, none of the data will be saved. Note that you cannot specify both -dbPath and -inMemory at once.
-optimizeDbBeforeStartup — Optimizes the underlying database tables before starting up DynamoDB on your computer. You must also specify -dbPath when you use this parameter.
-port value — The port number that DynamoDB will use to communicate with your application. If you do not specify this option, the default port is 8000.
Note
DynamoDB uses port 8000 by default. If port 8000 is unavailable, this command will throw an exception. You can use the -port option to specify a different port number. For a complete list of DynamoDB runtime options, including -port , type this command:
java -Djava.library.path=./DynamoDBLocal_lib -jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -help
-sharedDb — DynamoDB will use a single database file, instead of using separate files for each credential and region. If you specify -sharedDb, all DynamoDB clients will interact with the same set of tables regardless of their region and credential configuration.
